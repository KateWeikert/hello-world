# hello-world
In west Philadelphia born and raised,
On the playground where I spent most of my days.
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool,
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school.
When a couple of guys, they were up to no good,
Started making trouble in my neighbourhood.
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,
And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air."
